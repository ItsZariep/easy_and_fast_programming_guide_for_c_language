GTK (GIMP Toolkit) is a powerful, open-source toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It is built on top of GLib and used by applications like GIMP, Inkscape or Gnumeric.

GTK uses an object-oriented programming model in C through a system called GObject, and it integrates tightly with GLib for event loops, signals, and utilities.

## First GTK Program: A Simple Window

```c
#include <gtk/gtk.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    gtk_init(&argc, &argv);

    GtkWidget *window = gtk_window_new(GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
    gtk_window_set_title(GTK_WINDOW(window), "Hello, GTK!");
    gtk_window_set_default_size(GTK_WINDOW(window), 300, 200);

    g_signal_connect(window, "destroy", G_CALLBACK(gtk_main_quit), NULL);

    gtk_widget_show_all(window);
    gtk_main();

    return 0;
}
```

## Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. `#include <gtk/gtk.h>`

This includes the complete GTK+ header.

- Provides access to widgets like `GtkWindow`, `GtkButton`, `GtkLabel`, and layout containers.
- Also includes GLib and GObject headers automatically.
- 
### 2. `gtk_init(&argc, &argv);`

Initializes GTK and parses any GTK-specific command-line options.

- You must call this before using any GTK functions.
- It modifies `argc`/`argv` to remove GTK-related flags.

### 3. Creating a Window

```c
GtkWidget *window = gtk_window_new(GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
```

- Creates a new top-level application window.
- `GtkWidget` is a generic pointer for all GTK widgets.

### 4. Setting Window Properties

```c
gtk_window_set_title(GTK_WINDOW(window), "Hello, GTK!");
gtk_window_set_default_size(GTK_WINDOW(window), 300, 200);
```

- Sets the window title and default size (in pixels).
- `GTK_WINDOW()` is a macro that casts to `GtkWindow*` safely.
- 
### 5. Handling Events (Signals)

```c
g_signal_connect(window, "destroy", G_CALLBACK(gtk_main_quit), NULL);
```

- GTK uses a signal system to handle events.
- `"destroy"` is emitted when the window is closed.
- `gtk_main_quit` stops the GTK event loop, ending the application.

### 6. Displaying Widgets

```c
gtk_widget_show_all(window);
```

- Makes the window (and any contained widgets) visible.

### 7. Entering the Main Loop

```c
gtk_main();
```

- Starts the GTK event loop, which waits for and dispatches events (keyboard, mouse, etc.).
- Your program stays here until `gtk_main_quit()` is called.

## Compilation with GTK

Use `pkg-config` with GTK for proper flags and linking:

```bash
gcc gtk_example.c $(pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk4) -o gtk_example
```

If you're using GTK 3 instead of GTK 4, replace `gtk4` with `gtk+-3.0`:

```bash
gcc gtk_example.c $(pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0) -o gtk_example
```

## Output

Running the program will show a basic empty window titled “Hello, GTK!”.

## GTK and GLib

| Feature                 | Provided By |
| ----------------------- | ----------- |
| Data types, memory, I/O | GLib        |
| Objects, signals        | GObject     |
| GUI widgets, layout     | GTK         |

GTK depends on both GLib and GObject, so understanding them is helpful for larger applications.

## Summary

> GTK allows you to build native desktop applications in C with windows, buttons, and layouts. It builds on top of GLib and GObject, giving you a full-featured and portable GUI toolkit using C.
