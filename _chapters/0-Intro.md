## Easy and Programming guide For C language

Welcome to Easy and fast Programming guide For C language  (EPF). This is a project designed to explain a programming language in a straightforward and accessible manner, especially for beginners.

This documentation covers the essential aspects of the modern C (**C17**).

C17 (also known as ISO/IEC 9899:2018) is a minor revision of the C programming language standard, primarily focused on bug fixes and clarifications over the previous C11 standard. It maintains backward compatibility and doesn't introduce major new features. In this context, we will look at the basic structure of C language according to the C17 standard.

Therefore, is important to use a moden compiler before following this document or some aspects din't work correctly.
